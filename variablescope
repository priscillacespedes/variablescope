What is scope? Your explanation should include the idea of global vs. block scope.
Variable scope is a set of rules that define which parts of your code can access a particular variable. 
It's what allows us to reuse variable names at different points in our code, without things breaking.
Global scope that  can be retrieved and altered anywhere in your code base.
Block scope is only accessible within the function's block of instructions.
When you declare a variable in the global scope, it is available everywhere in your code. 
Any variable that is declared outside of a function in JavaScript has global scope.
That means that it is only accessible within the function's block of instructions. 
When the function has finished executing, the variable disappears.
Crucially, when we create and assign a value to a block scoped variable, 
the global variable is untouched. 

Why are global variables avoided?
Because the code becomes bug prone and harder to collaborate on and they
tend to make unintended side effects in a program more likely

Explain JavaScript's strict mode
When strict mode is enabled, any time a variable is declared without the let or const keyword, 
an error will be triggered

What are side effects, and what is a pure function?
A side effect is when a function reaches outside its local scope up into a 
parent scope and alters a value that lives there.
A function is said to be pure when it is both determinate and has no side effects. 
With the exception of functions that are specifically meant to have side effects
